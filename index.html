        <div class="mission-descr">
          <p>Our journey began in 2007 when three friends with a total of over 60 years of experience in construction industry have decided to change their safe jobs for a challenge. Since then the company has steadily grown and in 2021 we marked another milestone in our history by hiring our 200th employee.<br><br>

          Our philosophy stems from anticipating and preventing potential issues both in planning and execution stages. By mapping out the projects and analyizng each stage we can eliminate problems before they even appear.  This resulted in less tahn 2% of projects managed by us completed with more than 2 weeks of delay.<br><br>

          This approach along with our expertise and care of our workers has allowed us to become one of the industry leaders and awarded silver Build Your Staff certificate as well as Construct Award in Innovation for last three years running.
